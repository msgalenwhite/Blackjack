### Blackjack

This is a challenge assigned by Launch Academy to practice Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development.

### Tests

Tests can be run using 'rspec'

### Personal Goal

I want to focus on practicing writing tests.  This has been one of my weaknesses in the past and I know that, by approaching this challenge from a Test-Driven perspective, I will improve my ability to write tests as well as decide what should be tested.

### Current Challenge

- How to write tests for methods that involve user input?

- How to write tests for methods that involve random elements?
  ANSWER: In this instance, the method that was going to be outputting the strings was split into two methods.  That way I had a method whose only job was to take in arguments and output the correct strings, which is much simpler to test because you can easily control the input.
